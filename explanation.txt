So the Indexing part in function 3 is performed on three columns of the business fields that we use in function 2:
  id,
  latitude and
  longitude
And 2 review fields:
  business_id,
  stars.
This means that by creating such column indexes we achieve faster access to these values for all the records in the business and review tables.
Because of how many requests we get this short improvement building up and as the end result gain time boost in querying the database.

Dropping the same indexes in function 4 is important to see the effect of indexing in further compilations as otherwise
we will use previously created indexes.
